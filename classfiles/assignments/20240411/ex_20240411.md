### Summary of Requirements

1. **Stock Selection**: Choose five stocks for which historical data will be pulled.
2. **API Looping**: Use a pattern to loop through the five selected stocks and pull all necessary data. Implement looping through API calls, using the `nexturl` value to fetch subsequent pages of data.
3. **Research**: Read the Polygon.io documentation to fully understand the data being retrieved.
4. **Data Export**: Dump the retrieved data into a CSV file for each stock, stored in a specific folder.
5. **Parameterization**: Create parameters within the function to allow for the adjustment of the aggregate time span and the date ranges for the data retrieval.
6. **Incremental Mode**: Implement two modes of operation:
   - **Full Historical Backfill**: Pulls all historical data from a specified start date (April 1).
   - **Incremental Mode**: Detects if data has already been pulled from the start date and, if so, only pulls data from the end of the last load to the current date.

### Exercise Instructions

#### Part 1: Preparation
1. **Research and Setup**:
   - Read and understand the relevant sections of the Polygon.io API documentation.
   - Install necessary Python packages, including `pandas`, `requests`, and `datetime`.

#### Part 2: Implementing the Data Retrieval
1. **Choose Stocks**: Select five stocks you are interested in analyzing.
2. **Function Definition**: Create a Python function `fetch_stock_data` with parameters for stock symbols, aggregate time span, date ranges, and operation mode (full or incremental).
3. **API Calls**:
   - Use the provided URL pattern to construct your API request. Replace the stock symbol and dates as needed based on function parameters.
   - Implement looping to handle pagination through the `nexturl` feature of the API. This might involve checking if `nexturl` exists in the response and then making subsequent requests.
4. **Data Handling**:
   - For each stock, save the retrieved data into a DataFrame.
   - Export each DataFrame to a CSV file, named after the stock symbol, in a designated folder.

#### Part 3: Parameterization and Modes
1. **Parameters**: Ensure your function accepts parameters for different time aggregates (e.g., 10 seconds) and custom date ranges.
2. **Modes**:
   - **Full Historical Mode**: This mode ignores existing data and pulls all data from the specified start date.
   - **Incremental Mode**: Requires a mechanism to detect the last date for which data was pulled. This can be implemented by reading the existing CSV file for the stock (if it exists), finding the latest date, and starting the new data pull from the day after.

#### Part 4: Testing and Validation
1. **Run Your Code**: Test your function with the selected stocks, ensuring both full and incremental modes work as expected.
2. **Validate Data**: Check the CSV files to ensure data integrity and that the incremental mode does not duplicate data.
