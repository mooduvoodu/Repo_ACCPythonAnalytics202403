### Exercise: Fetching and Processing Stock Tickers Using Python and Pandas

#### Objective:
The goal of this exercise is to familiarize you with the use of Python and the Pandas library to work with JSON data obtained from an API call. You will learn how to fetch data in a paginated manner using the `requests` library, convert this data into a Pandas DataFrame, and manipulate the DataFrame to analyze the stock tickers.

#### Requirements:
- Use the `requests` library to make API calls.
- Utilize Pandas for data manipulation and JSON data conversion.
- Handle pagination in API calls to retrieve the complete list of common stock tickers.

#### Instructions:
1. Import the necessary libraries: `requests` and `pandas`.
2. Define a function `fetch_tickers` that retrieves all stock ticker data from the API.
   - The function should handle pagination using the `next_url` provided in the API response.
   - Use the API endpoint: `'https://api.polygon.io/v3/reference/tickers?type=CS&market=stocks&active=true&limit=100&apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY'`.
   - Replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` with the actual API key provided.
3. Once all data is fetched, the function should return a Pandas DataFrame containing all stock ticker information.
4. Use Pandas' built-in JSON normalization method to convert the list of tickers into a DataFrame.
5. Demonstrate the usage of your function by fetching the data and then display the first 10 rows of the DataFrame.
6. Ensure error handling for the API call, including invalid API key or network issues.

#### Hints:
- The initial API URL provided is used for the first request. Subsequent requests should use the `next_url` found in the response JSON to get further pages of data.
- Use a loop to continue making requests until `next_url` is `None`.
- Make use of `pd.json_normalize` to easily convert JSON data into a DataFrame.
